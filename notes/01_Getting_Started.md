# Recent Work

Just  recently got done with the following React App, which we can derive this codebase from:

* [reactjs - buy/sell indicator functionality](https://github.com/pwdel/dockerreactjs)

Our objective is to integrate a flask app in with this React functionality, to be able to later connect machine learning functionality in order to send a buy/sell signal.

Additional features may include performance indicators and dashboards showing how the trading strategy may have performed over a particular time period.

## Getting Started!

Typically in the past we have opted not to build virtual environments and send requirements.txt to Dockerfiles, but rather to build said requirements.txt files manually so as to be careful about which dependencies are being used and to minimize dependencies.

The project structure advised in [1] is the following:
